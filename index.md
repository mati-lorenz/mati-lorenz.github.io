## About Me

I am a computational neuroscientist with a background in physics, data science, and neural modeling. Currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, I lead theoretical and computational research on multivariate neural information coding. I am the lead developer of the Multivariate Information in Neuroscience Toolbox (MINT), which facilitates high-dimensional analysis of neural data.

My research integrates information theory, electrophysiology, and spiking network models to decode the principles of neural computation.
